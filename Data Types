### Mutable Data Types (Can update/delete its state & contents)
    - List, Dictionary, Byte Array
### Immutable Data Types (Cannot change its state & contents)
    - Int, Float, Complex, String, Tuple, Set

### Numeric ###
  Integer
    a = 5, print(a, "is of type ", type(a))     # 5 is of type <class 'int'>
  Float (with points)
    a = 2.0, print(a, "is of type ", type(a))     # 2.0 is of type <class 'float'>
  Complex Numbers
    a = 1+2j, print(a, "is of type ", type(a))     # (1+2j) is of type <class 'complex'>
    
### Sequence ###
  String (Collection of one or more characters put in single/double/triple quotes, where multilines strings can be denoted using triple quotes ''' or """)
    s = "This is a string"
    print(s)
    
  [] List (Ordered sequence of items separated by commas. It is one of the most used datatype in python and very flexible)
    l = [10,'sw',5.5]
    l[2] = 6                # It will update the item at index 2 i.e. 5.5
    print(l, type(l)))
    
  () Tuple (Ordered sequence of items separated by commas. But items cannot be updated. Fast processing than LIST)
    t = (10,20,'hello')
    print(t, type(t))

### Others
  {} Dictionary (Unordered collection of items which is key-value pairs. Keys will be unique and cannnot be used more than once, Mostly used with DATABASES)
    d = {'name':'',
         'age':20}
    print(d, type(d))
    print(d['name'])

  {} Set (Unordered collection of items, Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable)
    s = {1,2,3}
    print(s)
    
    s1 = {10,20,30,10}
    print(s1)                 # It will automatically remove the duplicate items in a set.
